Rules 

Drones are great and can be used for a lot of useful purposes. They can be used for logistics, monitoring, surveys and many other things for good.

But the very same drones can also be used by the bad people to carry bombs which can destroy this city, so you have to destroy these drones before they destroy you and to do that you have to follow these simple rules.
 
There are three rouge drones- Mavic, Hypo and Milgrade.

The aim of the game is to release weapons by pressing the button to destroy the drone before they reach you. There will be three types of weapons, and these are drone gun, catch-net and Bazooka each one for a specific threat as follows:-

Drone gun can only destroy a Mavic, a Hypo can only destroy a catch-net, and a Bazooka can only destroy a Milgrade. 

Note* If you play for 1 minute you earn 1 coin, and
 if you play for 10 minutes, you earn 1 diamond. 

So keep this in mind while playing this game and donâ€™t forget to try your best 
I know you can do it.
